# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, which is a data analysis technique used to identify patterns and characteristics in data sets. It's often the first step in data analysis, and can help data scientists: 

Uncover patterns: Find unexpected features and outliers in the data 

Summarize data: Get a sense of the main characteristics of a data set 

Test hypotheses: Formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments 

Detect anomalies: Spot issues in the data 

Develop models: Create parsimonious models
